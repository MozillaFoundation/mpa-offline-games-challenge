# Offline Games Challenge Personas

A persona is

- An imaginary user.
- Based on observations or understandings of actual potential or current users.
- Detailed enough so it feels real to the designer, so they can imagine the personaâ€™s needs and responses to a product or project.

Think of what brings you to this project and drives you to contribute. Look for allies and potential project recruits like these who might join you!

***Grace is a Mozilla Club Captain and entrepreneur in a community with low connectivity.*** She learned about the sprint from the Mozilla Clubs Facebook page. She frequently adapts lesson plans and teaching resources to work offline so her students can learn the concepts, skills, and vocabulary others learn online. She is excited to schedule her club to meet during the sprint so her learners can contribute their ideas to this challenge. She has also invited nearby Club Captains and her support network to help her and others working on the Offline Games challenge throughout the sprint. Grace plans to host a site for her learners and friends at the local workspace for entrepreneurs where she works and holds club meetings.

***Dina is a designer who kept following Mozilla after its rebranding.*** She learned about the sprint from a Mozilla tweet. Dina loves prototyping with paper and other modeling materials. She recruits a few co-workers to help her invent a game about privacy, security, and digital inclusion during the sprint. She plans to contribute design ideas if other projects need them if her game gets stuck.
 
***Mo is a teacher and open web supporter who teaches in a place that tightly controls use of the Internet.*** Mo learns about the sprint from friends he has made over the years who share a passion for the web and a frustration with how his locality limits access to it. Mo may not contribute to the project online, but he's inspired by it to develop games he can teach his learners that deal with online privacy, security, and inclusion, but look like normal playground games. He hopes he can teach the spirit of the web offline more easily than he is allowed to online.
