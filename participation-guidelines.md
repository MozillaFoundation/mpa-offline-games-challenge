# Participation Guidelines

As contributors to the Mozilla Privacy Arcade Project, you agree to:

- Share work in a way that makes sense to you. For example:
  - New GitHub users might copy and paste text from a Google Doc or text editor into an issue so that project leads can add that content to the repo for them.
  - New GitHub users might copy and paste links to work shared in another platform, like Google Docs, so that project leads can add that content to the repo for them.
  - Experienced GitHub users might clone the repo and add their content directly to it with Git, GitHub desktop, or another client.
- Communicate in ways that make sense to you, such as through email, IRC, Skype, or another chat client.
- Work as openly as possible with due respect for others' privacy choices and sense of agency.
- Follow the 50/50 rule: for each issue you raise or problem you identify, try to propose a solution, as well.
- Follow the Nth rule: try to “speak” or comment only 1/Nth of the time to allow others to speak, where N is the total number of active contributors on the project.
- Avoid using jargon and ask for clarification when you need it.
- Provide feedback in a timely way when invited to do so.
